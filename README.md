# COVID-Housing-Comparison Project Proposal

Our project is to uncover patterns between COVID-19 cases in Marion, Hancock, Johnson, Hamilton, Hendricks and Boone county Indiana residendential real-estate trends.  

We will compare COVID data from the Indiana State Department of Health for June to December 2020, and housing data pulled from MIBOR for June to December 2019 and 2020.

Questions to be explored include: Did COVID cases effect house prices in Marion and surrounding areas.
  As number of cases went up did listings increase or decrease?
  Did housing inventory decrease in Marion and increase elsewhere. Did the change reflect the number of COVID cases in those areas.
