# COVID-Housing-Comparison Project Proposal

Our project is to uncover patterns between COVID-19 cases and possible effects on residential real-estate trends. We will focus on Marion, Hancock, Johnson, Hamilton, Hendricks and Boone counties in Indiana.  

We are using COVID data from the Indiana State Department of Health for June to December 2020, and housing data pulled from Metropolitan Indanapolis Board of Realtors database (MIBOR) for June to December 2019 and 2020.

Questions to be explored include: 1) Did COVID cases effect house prices in Marion and surrounding areas?
  2) As the number of cases went up did listings increase or decrease?
  3) Did housing inventory decrease in the Indy Metro area over time in June-December 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic?
